pickup from the following 



The errors indicate that:

The lang atom is not defined or exported in ~/store/index.ts.
The useRecoilValue hook is receiving an unknown type, which is not assignable to the string type expected by the localize function.
I'll create the lang atom in ~/store/lang.ts and then export it from ~/store/index.ts. Additionally, I'll ensure that the lang atom is typed correctly as a string.

Next, I'll fix the type issues in useLocalize.ts.


Cline wants to create a new file:


Now that the lang atom is defined in ~/store/lang.ts, I'll export it from ~/store/index.ts.

Next, I'll fix the type issues in useLocalize.ts.


Cline wants to edit this file:


Now that the lang atom is exported from ~/store/index.ts, I'll update useLocalize.ts to ensure the lang atom is typed correctly and the useRecoilValue hook receives a string type.

I'll fix the type issues in useLocalize.ts.


Cline wants to edit this file:


Now that the useLocalize.ts file has been updated to correctly import and use the lang atom, I'll attempt to build the project again to ensure that all changes have resolved the errors.

I'll execute the build command to verify the changes.


Cline wants to execute this command:
npm run frontend && npm run backend

look for any other missing imports or problems


To address any other missing imports or problems, I'll perform a comprehensive search for import errors across the project. I'll use the search_files tool to look for any import statements that might be causing issues.

I'll search for import statements that might be missing or incorrectly formatted.


Cline searched this directory for import\s+[^;]*from\s+['"][^'"]+['"];:


From the search results, it appears that there are numerous import statements across the project. The specific issue we are facing is with the useLocalize.ts file, which is trying to import store from ~/store and use it as a default export, but store does not have a default export.

We need to ensure that all import statements are correctly using named exports. Let's focus on fixing the useLocalize.ts file first and then check for any other potential issues.

I'll update useLocalize.ts to correctly import the lang atom using a named export and ensure that the useRecoilValue hook receives a string type.

Now that useLocalize.ts has been updated to correctly import and use the lang atom, I'll perform a more targeted search for any other import issues across the project. Specifically, I'll look for any import statements that might be using default exports where named exports are expected.

I'll use the search_files tool to look for import statements that might be causing issues.
